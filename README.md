### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. jQuery is a widely used JavaScript library. A consolidated form of JavaScript, jQuery provides users with shortcuts for writing more complex JavaScript code. jQuery can perform HTML document traversal and manipulation as well as animation and event handling. Any user can download, manipulate, and build upon jQuery in their own projects. The library resides in a .js file that must be linked to the HTML document. 

2. jQuery is a cross-browser tool, meaning it works across a multitude of browsers. The jQuery Foundation (now "JS Foundation") maintains the jQuery library and publishes new iterations as they are developed.

3. Every jQuery statement begins with the "$" symbol. Doing so specifies that any following code should be interpreted using the jQuery library. When performing actions, jQuery specifies the selector for the element associated with a particular event and then acts upon built-in methods that specify the event and/or action.
